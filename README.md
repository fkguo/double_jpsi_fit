# Fit to the LHCb double $J/\psi$ spectrum

This is a coupled-channel analysis of the LHCb data reporting the $X(6900)$ in [arXiv:2006.18957](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16957). 
Our results are presented in [arXiv:2009.07795](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07795). 

We consider coupled channels of two kinds:

* two channels: $J/\psi J/\psi$ and $J/\psi \psi(2S)$
* three channels: $J/\psi J/\psi$, $J/\psi \psi(2S)$ and $J/\psi \psi(3770)$
